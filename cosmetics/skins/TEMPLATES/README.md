When Creating Skins You Must do The Following:
1. For **Displays**, the image size *MUST* be _**640x360**_ resolution
2. For **Bombs**, the skin **MUST** have different images, divided in folders for the **ropes** (Rope, RopeMid, and RopeEnd), the **bomb**, the **spark thingy**, and the **explosion**.
3. For **Hearts**, image **MUST** be _**100x100**_ resolution
4. adding custom effects are optional, but always create an **effects.json** file for these.

if you need referencing, use the template images.
